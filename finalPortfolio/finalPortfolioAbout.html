<h1>About</h1>

<p>My name is Beatrice, and I am a student pursuing Media Studies at Hunter College and a minor in Asian American Studies. I'm a Filipino-American, born in the Philippines and moved to the US at a very young age. I think growing up with this background has shaped me greatly; coming from a family with traditional values and living in a country with an emphasis on independence has been a constant conflict in my life.  However, it's also given me a purpose- especially with my time at Hunter and the AAAPISI project, I've gained an interest in spreading the knowledge of issues that Filipinos/Filipino-Americans face, and I especially want to explore the dissonance of the younger Asian American generation’s diaspora since that feeling of alienation was a huge part of my identity while I was growing up.</p>

<p>I am especially interested in the aspects of web design, graphic design and game design in my field. I have delved a little in film, specifically documentary film, and think it would be interesting to learn more about as well. I am a mostly self-taught artist (and cartoon doodler) and would love to pursue fine arts or go to art school some day; creativity has always been very important to express to me. I love learning many things, and though I would like to hone my skills in my talents, my most important philosophy is to use every bit of knowledge I acquire to help me become a better, kinder person. Other than my creative endeavors, I like having a elusive sleep schedule and looking at pictures of cute things.</p>

<p><b>January 20, 2018:</b>  RIP Mom. I miss you, and think about you every day.</p>
